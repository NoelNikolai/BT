## Abstract 
The present study is an exploratory development of an LLM-Prompting-Approach to measure cognitive engagement in social media. 
It further serves as an analysis of its validity and usefulness. It begins with tracking the role of social media for corporate communication departments and elaborating on limited KPIs for social media platforms.
Subsequently, the thesis discusses different perspectives in literature to merge a definition of cognitive engagement in social media. Based on this and some technical details and characteristics of OpenAI's latest Large Language Model (LLM), GPT-4, a prompt will be crafted to measure comments on corporate communication posts on LinkedIn automatically. 
These LinkedIn comments were gathered within a questionnaire answered by 788 participants.
The paper finds relevant correlations to previous methods of identifying cognitive engagement through self-reporting scales. 
Further, it suggests the LLM-Prompting-Approach is beneficial for identifying either topics or communities deeply resonating with brands. 
In conclusion, the paper advises using this method as a key performance indicator for social media in combination with existing ones to build improved and targeted social media marketing strategies.

## Introduction
> "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”  
(Clarke, 1962, p. 36)

What people experienced with the Industrial Revolution in the early 19th century, we are now experiencing with AI. This is a transformative time with significant changes ahead. 
It began with the introduction of large language models to the masses in 2022. This was surely a magical moment for people who previously had never engaged with AI. 
Then many influential Newspapers and Businesses labeled 2023 as the year of AI (Perrigo, 2023; Nadella, 2024). For each month, many advancements have been made, especially concerning generative AI models that generate new data and patterns from old ones. 
While in the past year, large language models were becoming capable of much more than transforming serious emails from your boss at work into funny iambic pentameter poems, some realized the potential of models applicable to a vast field (Wu et al., 2023). 
Because every time something is new and seems magical, scholars or perhaps humanity as a whole must understand it until it is no longer magical.
With scholars starting to analyze intricate psychological phenomena such as personality with just AI textual analysis of the Twitter communication of founders (McCarthy et al., 2023), we wondered what else would be possible to understand via analyzing language. 
As one of the largest sources of textual interaction on a variety of topics, social media is an ideal sphere for exploring the capabilities of AI in understanding more complex human association patterns and cognition. 
Moreover, social media is a strong marketing and communication tool, thus highly relevant for businesses. Therefore, this study aims to develop an LLM-Prompting-Approach for measuring a psychological construct and validating it via self-reporting scales – the more traditional method of measuring psychological concepts.
